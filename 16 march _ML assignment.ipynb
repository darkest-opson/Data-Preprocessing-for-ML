    "Q1: Define overfitting and underfitting in machine learning. What are the consequences of each, and how\n",

    "\n",
    "Overfitting occurs when our machine learning model tries to cover all the data points or more than the required data points present in the given dataset. Because of this, the model starts caching noise and inaccurate values present in the dataset, and all these factors reduce the efficiency and accuracy of the model. The overfitted model has low bias and high variance.\n",
    "The chances of occurrence of overfitting increase as much we provide training to our model. It means the more we train our model, the more chances of occurring the overfitted model.\n",
    "\n",

    "Underfitting occurs when our machine learning model is not able to capture the underlying trend of the data. To avoid the overfitting in the model, the fed of training data can be stopped at an early stage, due to which the model may not learn enough from the training data. As a result, it may fail to find the best fit of the dominant trend in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of underfitting, the model is not able to learn enough from the training data, and hence it reduces the accuracy and produces unreliable predictions.\n",

    "\n",
    "Train with more data\n",
    "\n",
    "With the increase in the training data, the crucial features to be extracted become prominent. The model can recognize the relationship between the input attributes and the output variable. The only assumption in this method is that the data to be fed into the model should be clean; otherwise, it would worsen the problem of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Data augmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative method to training with more data is data augmentation, which is less expensive and safer than the previous method. Data augmentation makes a sample data look slightly different every time the model processes it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Addition of noise to the input data \n",
    "\n",
    "Another similar option as data augmentation is adding noise to the input and output data. Adding noise to the input makes the model stable without affecting data quality and privacy while adding noise to the output makes the data more diverse. Noise addition should be done in limit so that it does not make the data incorrect or too different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Every model has several parameters or features depending upon the number of layers, number of neurons, etc.  The model can detect many redundant features or features determinable from other features leading to unnecessary complexity. We very well know that the more complex the model, the higher the chances of the model to overfit. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation is a robust measure to prevent overfitting. The complete dataset is split into parts. In standard K-fold cross-validation, we need to partition the data into k folds. Then, we iteratively train the algorithm on k-1 folds while using the remaining holdout fold as the test set. This method allows us to tune the hyperparameters of the neural network or machine learning model and test it using completely unseen data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Simplify data\n",
    "\n",
    "Till now, we have come across model complexity to be one of the top reasons for overfitting. The data simplification method is used to reduce overfitting by decreasing the complexity of the model to make it simple enough that it does not overfit. Some of the procedures include pruning a decision tree, reducing the number of parameters in a neural network, and using dropout on a neutral network. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "If overfitting occurs when a model is too complex, reducing the number of features makes sense. Regularization methods like Lasso, L1 can be beneficial if we do not know which features to remove from our model. Regularization applies a \"penalty\" to the input parameters with the larger coefficients, which subsequently limits the model's variance. \n",

    "Ensembling\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a machine learning technique that combines several base models to produce one optimal predictive model. In Ensemble learning,  the predictions are aggregated to identify the most popular result. Well-known ensemble methods include bagging and boosting, which prevents overfitting as an ensemble model is made from the aggregation of multiple models. \n",
    "\n",
    "Early stopping\n",
    "\n",
    "This method aims to pause the model's training before memorizing noise and random fluctuations from the data. There can be a risk that the model stops training too soon, leading to underfitting. One has to come to an optimum time/iterations the model should train. \n",
    "\n",
    "Adding dropout layers\n",
    "\n",
    "Large weights in a neural network signify a more complex network. Probabilistically dropping out nodes in the network is a simple and effective method to prevent overfitting. In regularization, some number of layer outputs are randomly ignored or “dropped out” to reduce the complexity of the model. "

    "How can you determine whether your model is overfitting or underfitting?\n",

    "Overfitting and underfitting are two common problems that can occur in machine learning models. Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and learns the training data too well, which results in poor generalization to new, unseen data. Underfitting, on the other hand, occurs when a model is too simple and cannot capture the underlying patterns in the training data, resulting in poor performance on both the training and testing data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Training and testing accuracy: The training accuracy measures how well the model fits the training data, while the testing accuracy measures how well the model generalizes to new data. If the training accuracy is high but the testing accuracy is low, the model may be overfitting.\n",

    "Learning curves: Learning curves plot the model's training and testing accuracy or error as a function of the number of training samples or epochs.

    "\n",
    "Bias and variance are two important concepts in machine learning that can affect the performance of a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias refers to the error that is introduced by approximating a real-world problem with a simplified model. High bias models have a tendency to underfit the training data and perform poorly on both the training and testing data. For example, a linear regression model that tries to fit a non-linear relationship between the input features and the target variable may have high bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance, on the other hand, refers to the error that is introduced by the model's sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training data. High variance models have a tendency to overfit the training data and perform well on the training data but poorly on the testing data. For example, a decision tree with high depth or low regularization may have high variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the difference between high bias and high variance models, consider the example of a binary classification problem. A high bias model might always predict the majority class, resulting in high accuracy on the training data but poor performance on the testing data. This is because the model is too simple and cannot capture the underlying patterns in the data. A high variance model, on the other hand, might fit the training data very closely, resulting in low training error but high testing error. This is because the model is too complex and is fitting the noise in the data, rather than the underlying patterns."
