    "Q1. What is data encoding? How is it useful in data science?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data encoding is the process of transforming data from one format to another. In data science, encoding is useful for transforming categorical data into a numerical format that can be used in machine learning algorithms. Encoding enables us to represent data in a way that can be more easily analyzed and processed by machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What is nominal encoding? Provide an example of how you would use it in a real-world scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nominal encoding is a type of categorical encoding that assigns a unique numerical value to each category in a categorical variable. For example, if you have a categorical variable representing the color of a car, you could assign the value 1 to red, 2 to blue, 3 to green, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a real-world scenario, nominal encoding could be used to transform categorical data such as customer gender or occupation into numerical values that can be used in a machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. In what situations is nominal encoding preferred over one-hot encoding? Provide a practical example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nominal encoding is preferred over one-hot encoding when the number of categories in a categorical variable is large. One-hot encoding can create a large number of new columns, which can make the dataset more difficult to work with and may even cause performance issues in the machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you have a categorical variable representing a person's job title and there are thousands of unique job titles in the dataset, using one-hot encoding would create thousands of new columns. In this case, nominal encoding would be a better option as it assigns a unique numerical value to each category, allowing the data to be represented in a more compact format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Suppose you have a dataset containing categorical data with 5 unique values. Which encoding technique would you use to transform this data into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms? Explain why you made this choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the categorical data has five unique values, I would use nominal encoding to transform the data into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms. Nominal encoding assigns a unique numerical value to each category, allowing the data to be represented in a compact format that can be easily processed by machine learning models. In this case, the number of categories is small enough that using one-hot encoding would not result in an unmanageable number of new columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. In a machine learning project, you have a dataset with 1000 rows and 5 columns. Two of the columns are categorical, and the remaining three columns are numerical. If you were to use nominal encoding to transform the categorical data, how many new columns would be created? Show your calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to use nominal encoding to transform the two categorical columns, we would create two new columns, one for each categorical variable, with each column containing the assigned numerical value for each category. Therefore, the resulting dataset would have 7 columns (5 original columns + 2 new columns created by nominal encoding).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. You are working with a dataset containing information about different types of animals, including their species, habitat, and diet. Which encoding technique would you use to transform the categorical data into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms? Justify your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "To transform the categorical data in the animal dataset into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms, I would use a combination of nominal encoding and one-hot encoding. Nominal encoding could be used for the species variable, as there are likely a limited number of unique species represented in the dataset. One-hot encoding could be used for the habitat and diet variables, as these may have many possible categories. This approach would result in a dataset with a compact representation of the species variable and a more expanded representation of the habitat and diet variables."

    "To transform the categorical data in the customer churn dataset into numerical data, I would use nominal encoding for the contract type variable and leave the gender variable as binary (e.g., 0 for female and 1 for male). Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I would implement the encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "Convert the contract type variable to a numerical format using nominal encoding. For example, I could assign the value 1 to a month-to-month contract, 2 to a one-year contract, and 3 to a two-year contract.\n",

    "Leave the gender variable as binary, assigning the value 0 to female and 1 to male.\n",
